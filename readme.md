The difference between onCreateView and onViewCreated is

       oncreateView is used to inflate the fragment,  you can also Inflate the XML 
       layout for the Fragment in this callback.  The system calls this method to draw the Fragment
       UI for the first time.
        
        onViewCreated gets findViewById and calls a view (textview,imageview, edittext etc)
